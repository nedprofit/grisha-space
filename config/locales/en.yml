  label_header_description: "Ruby on Rails Developer"
  label_body_description_1: "I have been working with Ruby on Rails since 2017. During all this time I've come a long way from random orders on Upwork while still being a student at Bauman Moscow State Technical University to a leading Ruby on Rails developer. I keep my finger on the pulse of framework development: from UJS and Turbolinks work to modern Stimulus and Turbo."
  label_body_description_2: "I always look at work through the prism of capabilities, both my own and the workforce's, and am willing to put in the maximum amount of effort to improve processes. In any development I am guided first of all by testing my product; I describe business scenarios in Cucumber integration tests, check internal logic through RSpec unit tests and use Jest if necessary."
