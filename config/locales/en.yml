  label_header_description: "Ruby on Rails Developer"
  label_body_description_1: "I have been working with Ruby on Rails since 2017. During all this time I've come a long way from random orders on Upwork while still being a student at Bauman Moscow State Technical University to a leading Ruby on Rails developer. I keep my finger on the pulse of framework development: from UJS and Turbolinks work to modern Stimulus and Turbo."
  label_body_description_2: "I always look at the work through the prism of opportunities, both my own and working ones, and I am ready to put the maximum amount of effort to improve the processes. In any development I am guided not only by code cleanliness, but also by optimisation of everything I have written, I constantly use RbSpy, PGAdmin, NewRelic in my work."

  label_roadmap: "Roadmap Backend-developer"
  label_body_skills: "Any heights always start small, so I took two goals for my growth as a developer, namely to prepare the most comprehensive and extensive list of Ruby interview questions and to find the correct roadmap for a Backend developer. Both of these goals were done and allowed me to move in the most efficient way possible."
